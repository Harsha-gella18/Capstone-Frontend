## 📌 Abstract

This project presents an **AI-Powered Educational Chatbot** that provides instant, accurate, and context-aware answers to students’ academic queries. Built using a **serverless cloud architecture**, the chatbot employs **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to ensure responses are derived directly from prescribed curriculum materials.

The system uses **GPT-OSS-20B** as the Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language generation and **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search** for storing and retrieving textbook embeddings. Students can select their class and subject, engage in multi-turn conversations, and receive personalized responses. Features such as conversational memory, editable queries, and dynamic response regeneration promote active, self-directed learning.
